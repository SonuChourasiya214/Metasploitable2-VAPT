# 🔐 Metasploitable2 Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT)

A complete Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT) project performed on **Metasploitable2**, an intentionally vulnerable Linux-based virtual machine used for penetration testing practice.  
This project follows a real-world VAPT workflow including **Passive Recon, Active Recon, Enumeration, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Privilege Escalation**, and **Reporting**.

3. Set both to:
Network Mode: Host-Only / NAT
4. Confirm connectivity:
ping <metasploitable-ip>
